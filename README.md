This small AR game was written for the Meta 2 headset by Hannah Cairns <hannah.abigail.cairns@gmail.com>.

Send little green ships from stars you control to ones that you don't. Try to get as far from Earth as possible without getting eaten by the ambient metaintelligent computer virus that is scattered throughout space.

It is not finished. See issues for status.
